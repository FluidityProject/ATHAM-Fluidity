This test case is based on the 'Schar mountain case, hydrostatic flow' simulation, as described in Savre et al. (2016, Monthly Weather Review, 144:4349-4372), but with a reduced simulation time of 0.5 hours.

Due to subsequent code changes and/or tweaks to model parameters, results will be similar but not identical to those presented in the paper.
