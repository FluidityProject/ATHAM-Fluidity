This test case is based on the 'Density current' simulation (200m spatial resolution configuration), as described in Savre et al. (2016, Monthly Weather Review, 144:4349-4372).

Due to subsequent code changes and/or tweaks to model parameters, results will be similar but not identical to those presented in the paper.
